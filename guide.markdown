(1) Launch Photoshop. Select "Preferences > Plug-Ins..." in the menu, then check "Enable Remote Connections" checkbox, input your password, and click OK button. In case the checkbox was unchecked until this time, exit and restart Photoshop.

(2) Open your design data on Photoshop. If there are dialog boxes popping up, close them and make design data visible. After that, don't edit anything on Photoshop until data importing finishes.

(3) Launch Raplia. There should be a connection window. Select the Photoshop Service you configured, input your password, then click "Connect" button. Once it is successfully connected, document information will be shown. Select the loading scale from 100%, 50%, or 33.3%, then press "OK" button. The data loading will start.
